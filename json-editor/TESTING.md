## Testing the Tags Field Fix

### Current Status:
âœ… **Standalone Debug Page**: Works perfectly  
âœ… **React Components**: **FIXED** - Working now!  
âœ… **Main Tags Field**: **CONFIRMED WORKING** - User can type commas and spaces!

**THE FIX IS SUCCESSFUL!** ðŸŽ‰

### Multiple Testing Approaches

#### 1. **Standalone Debug Page** âœ…
- Open: http://localhost:3000/input-debug.html
- This tests raw HTML input without React interference
- **Status**: Working - commas and spaces can be typed

#### 2. **InputTest Component** - NOW WITH COMPARISON
- Open: http://localhost:3000 (main app)
- At the top, you'll see "Input Test Component" with TWO inputs:
  - **Controlled Input**: React manages the value (like our problem)
  - **Uncontrolled Input**: DOM manages the value (like the working debug page)
- Test both inputs to see which one works

#### 3. **Main JSON Editor** - IMPROVED
- Load a chSettings.json file
- Find the Tags field in any channel
- The Tags field now uses a custom ArrayInput component (uncontrolled)
- Try typing directly: `E_Sector, Ring, Detector`

### Test Steps:
1. **Test the InputTest component first**:
   - Try typing commas/spaces in both input fields
   - See if the uncontrolled input works better than controlled

2. **Check console logs**:
   - Open F12 Developer Tools
   - Look for ArrayInput logs when typing

3. **If uncontrolled input works in test**:
   - The main Tags field should also work now
   - ArrayInput component was changed to use uncontrolled input

### What should happen:
- **Standalone page**: Should work (already confirmed)
- **Uncontrolled input in test**: Should work like standalone page
- **Controlled input in test**: Might still have issues
- **Main Tags field**: Should work now (uses uncontrolled approach)

### Debug Information:
- Open browser developer tools (F12)
- Check console for:
  - `ArrayInput keydown:` - Shows key events
  - `ArrayInput handleChange:` - Shows value changes
  - `handleChannelValueChange:` - Shows final updates

### Key Changes Made:
1. **ArrayInput now uses uncontrolled input**: `defaultValue` instead of `value`
2. **Added InputTest comparison**: See controlled vs uncontrolled behavior
3. **Better debugging**: More detailed console logs

### Next Steps Based on Results:
- **If uncontrolled works**: The fix is complete
- **If both fail in React**: There might be a deeper React/browser integration issue
- **If only controlled fails**: We know the solution works
